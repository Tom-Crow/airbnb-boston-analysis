## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should be fine to run with any Python 3.* version

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I wanted to use Airbnb's Boston data to explore:

1. Where are the listings located?
2. How accurately can we predict a listing's price?
3. What are the main factors that influence a listing's price?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks relating to the above questions. The first notebook: ListingsAreasLatLon.ipynb looks at answering Question 1, where the listings are located. The second notebook: ListingsPricePrediction.ipynb looks at answering Questions 2 and 3.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The findings of the code can be found on [this](https://medium.com/@tomcrow.93/boston-airbnb-for-all-budgets-eb494061e67b) Medium post.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Credit to AirBnB for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston/version/1). Feel free to use the code here for whatever you want.
